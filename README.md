## The Problem
Managing lifeguard vigilance is crucial for ensuring safety and effectiveness. As a manager, identifying strengths and weaknesses in lifeguarding can be challenging without a structured approach. This project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard to improve processes, inform training focus, and enhance pool scanning delegation.

## Collecting Data
To gather relevant data:

- Daily Audits: Deck supervisors performed audits with a goal of one audit per day.
- Google Forms: Data collection was facilitated using Google Forms.
- Dropdown Questions: Employed dropdown questions to streamline data cleaning.

## Data Visualizations & Analysis
This section provides detailed descriptions of the various data charts used in the dashboard:

### Weekly Audits Average (Line Chart): 
![LineChart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66bcc081-f558-48af-bda4-6fbdb2dce2a9)
Displays the average number of weekly audits for the entire lifeguarding and supervising team. This line chart helps identify overall trends and patterns in audit performance.

### Teams' Audit Participation (Stacked Line Charts):

![Stacked Lines](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/059f84b3-8685-4b24-b879-2c1441812ea5)

Illustrates the audits completed per team on each weekday and per month. Given the consistent scheduling of teams, this visualization highlights any lapses in audit conduction or participation over time.

### Audit Results (Stacked Bar Graph):

![Stacked Bars](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f8ff8fa-a582-4928-9723-a012f7ad435f)

Shows the number of audits completed in each swimming lane, highlighting any specific lanes with recurring issues. The graph also compares the results in terms of passes, exceeds, and fails, providing a clear view of overall performance.

### Audit Distribution: 

![PieChart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4657e78b-d647-49cb-bb10-4a6e1920afb7)

Depicts the distribution of audits across the weekdays. An ideal distribution would show an equal number of audits per weekday, ensuring balanced audit coverage.

### Filters:

![Records](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de2890f2-6ee5-4d01-b31d-13028481d541)



The dashboard includes filters for date range, lifeguard name, weekday, lane number, and audit items. These filters facilitate on-the-go insights and detailed analysis of specific data points.

## Usage & Conclusion

Lifeguard instructors/supervisors utilize this dashboard daily to derive actionable insights. The data helps in making informed decisions about training focus and task delegation. Future enhancements could involve more detailed analysis of audit content, including factors like lifeguard position (sitting, standing, roving) and time of day, to further refine training and operational strategies. Additionally, adding clear and concise data definitions would allow this dashboard to be used more widely.
